Easily and with little setup inspect your data that you see in your plots!!

## Installation

We are using mamba to install dependencies and python environment:
- `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Fafa87/data-spec-loupe.git`
- `cd data-spec-loupe`
- `mamba env create -f environment.yml`
- `mamba activate data-spec-loupe`
- `pip install -e external/napari-feature-visualization`

## Usage

The usage is designed to be very simple:
- prepare the data in given format (images folder and tsv)
- run cli or create explorer class

For example to show image from `example_data/views` corresponding to data from `example_data/data_tracked.tsv`:
```
python -m dataspecloupe.cli.gui example_data/views example_data/data_tracked.tsv 
```

Optionally additional config yaml file can be specified:
```
python -m dataspecloupe.cli.gui example_data/views example_data/data_tracked.tsv --config_path example_data/data_config.yaml
```

The best way is it to run viewer along with the jupyter notebook analysis which allows for easier communication between analysis and viewer.
See [exploring.ipynb](notebooks/exploring.ipynb) for example processing and feature list.

### Explorer class 

It is the main class used to set up and control the napari viewer.  

Main features:
- specify subset of features to load and present
- specify features treated as categorical (for visualisation)
- specify new dataframe as features 
- showing selected dataframe rows in viewer:
  - navigate to the first view
  - highlight the visible selected objects using extra SELECTED feature
- option to move viewer to the selected view


### Images data format (tif folders)

This is a simple hierarchy of folders for each channel, e.g. we can have 3 folder:
- `GFP`
- `Trans`
- `UNIQUE_LABEL` (required)

Each (e.g. Trans) having files named like:
- `view_0_channel_Trans.tif`
- `view_1_channel_Trans.tif`

Each of the folders is loaded as a separate layer in `napari`. Only `UNIQUE_LABEL` is loaded as a label layer rest as
image layer.

### Numerical data format (tsv)

There are only a few constrains and required fields - the rest is treated as a features with some being categorical and some treated as continuous numbers:
- identification fields
- features fields

### Data specification yaml (optional)

Yaml config file example:
```yaml
category_features: [label, track_label, trench, trench_lineage, lineage_cellid, parent_lineage_cellid, cell_generation]
```

## Example

There is a full usage example prepared for exploring the numerical data calculated on the MOMA dataset:
- original sample of the MoMA data:

  - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YEvhkNB2lWOGFAuG1bmV7ZcwFE1FiDaR/view?usp=drive_link
- processed data (images and tsv):

## Roadmap

Currently, we can show the data and using visualisation plugin show features as colours. 
We can also show the data selected in analysis in viewer.

There is one more basic direction of information flow that are missing at the moment:

- selecting object in the viewer -> selecting data frame rows
  - adding points layer where point are added on those selected objects
  - exporting the labels where the points as list
  - getting data frame rows from labels

Another thing would be to have an option to specify which features to show as points in napari. They will be placed
at the mean position of the selected feature.

Also, it would be good to add proper installation instructions so that it is available in the python env everywhere.
